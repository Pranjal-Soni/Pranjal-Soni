#### Experience
* Data Science Intern (6 months)
  * Built deep learning models for computer vision project using the Pytorch framework for recognizing text from the images
  * Worked with transfer learning technique and used pre-trained models like Resnet, Efficientnet, Nfnets and attention models
  * Extract business keywords from articles using collocations and the RAKE algorithm
  * Performed data collection, preprocessing and labeling. Improve running time of the python scripts to enhance efficiency of the programs

#### Interest
* Understanding Data And Generating Key Insights
* Solving business problems with Data Science
* Work Automation

#### Currently Working On:
